Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

During Project Two, I worked on creating a pirate agent using deep Q learning to navigate a maze and locate treasure ahead of a human player. The project provided me with code, including setting up the environment
through the 'TreasureMaze' class, managing game experiences in 'GameExperience', and functions for model training and testing. My main responsibility was to finalize the Q learning algorithm by coding the training of
the network model within the maze environment. This task involved developing strategies for action selection, updating Q values and refining the model to achieve a win rate over multiple rounds.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

In this class, I've delved into the realm of computer science with a focus on intelligence and machine learning. Computer scientists play a role in crafting algorithms, coding software and building systems to tackle 
intricate challenges in different fields. Their efforts drive progress in technology, enhance productivity and introduce solutions that influence society across sectors like healthcare and entertainment.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As I have developed my understanding of coding, I've tackled challenges by dissecting them into more digestible parts. This includes grasping the problem domain, pinpointing needs and creating a systematic approach to
solving it. I proceed to tune the solution through testing and adjustments until it aligns with the desired results. Throughout this journey, I have blended my understanding with hands-on coding expertise to craft
algorithms that are not only powerful but also efficient.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ensuring obligations to both end users and the organization is crucial in the field of computer science. It's vital to guarantee that the technologies and algorithms we create are secure, unbiased and clear. This
involves protecting user information, reducing prejudices in AI systems, and considering the societal effects of our efforts. It is my duty to develop technology that benefits both users and the organization while
upholding standards, legal requirements and the values of the organization.
